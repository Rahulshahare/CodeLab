    I have name this project as 'Project Unemployment'. As we all know we have some little % of unemployment. 
    we are going to calculate the exact % of unemployment. If some one wish to register as unemployment then we are going to 
    ask him some information along with his name and email address.<br> 
    info is like
    <ul style="list-style-type:number">
      <li>Location : In location we are going to ask about his state, district and city</li>
      <li>Educational status:  going to ask the education to the person</li>
      <li>Skills : here we gonna provide the list of skills, and user have to select proper skills he/she aquire. </li>
      <li>Languages : in this we are going to ask about which and how many languages in which user can communicate. </li>
      <li>Job list : we are going to ask about dream job</li>
      <li>Next will be the reason behind being unemployed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    if we run this programm succuessfully with helping each other , then we will know the exact ratio of unemployment.
    and so many things like 
    <ul>
      <li>Which city or state or district contains how many numbers of peoples</li>
      <li>Educations of those ppls, or what kind of educated ppls we have</li>
      <li>we can find the skills of those ppls, wht kind of skills they have and what they can do</li>
      <li>we have a chance to know the reason behind being unemployed, everybody have their different reason, so we can 
        figure out whereever we are going wrong</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Unemployment</h3>
      <ul>
